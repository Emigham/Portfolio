Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my skills and past projects.

The portfolio is organized into different sections, including an "About Me" section, a "Skills" section, and a "Projects" section. The "About Me" section provides an overview of who I am and what I do. The "Skills" section highlights my technical abilities and areas of expertise. The "Work" section showcases a selection of my past projects, and descriptions.

The portfolio is responsive and can be viewed on various devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It uses CSS grid and Flexbox for layout and is designed to be clean and easy to navigate. The portfolio also uses JavaScript to provide interactive elements such as modal windows for project images and a smooth scrolling effect.

The portfolio also includes contact form and links to my social media profiles and resume.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy it!
